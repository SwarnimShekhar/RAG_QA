# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model for QA Bot

## Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot using a vector database (Pinecone) and a generative model (Cohere). The QA bot retrieves relevant information from a dataset and generates coherent answers based on user queries.

## Part 3: Documentation

1. **Model Architecture**: The architecture of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model is designed to integrate the retrieval of relevant documents with the generation of responses. The key components of the architecture are:

2. **Document Upload**: Users upload PDF documents containing the information required for answering queries.

3. **Text Extraction**: The text is extracted from the uploaded PDF documents using the PyPDF2 library, ensuring that the content is available for processing.

4. **Text Chunking**: The extracted text is divided into manageable chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which helps in effectively embedding and retrieving information.

5. **Document Embedding**: Each chunk of text is converted into a vector representation using OllamaEmbeddings, which allows the model to understand the semantic meaning of the text.

6. **Vector Database**: The embeddings are stored in a vector database (Pinecone) for efficient retrieval based on similarity.

7. **Query Processing**: User queries are embedded in the same way as the document chunks to allow for a direct comparison and retrieval of relevant information.

8. **Retrieval**: The system retrieves the top-k relevant document chunks based on their similarity to the query embedding using the Pinecone database.

9. **Reranking**: The retrieved documents are reranked to improve the relevance of the information using Cohere's reranking model, ensuring that the most contextually appropriate documents are prioritized.

10. **Response Generation**: The final response is generated using the Groq model, which takes into account the context provided by the retrieved documents and the original user query.

### Approach to Retrieval
**The retrieval process involves the following steps**:

1. After a user uploads a PDF document, the text is extracted and chunked.
2. Each chunk is embedded and stored in Pinecone.
3. When a user submits a query, the query is also embedded, and the system retrieves the top k relevant document embeddings.
4. The retrieved documents are then reranked to ensure that the most relevant information is provided.

### Generative Responses
The generative aspect of the model leverages the Groq API, which formulates responses based on the context retrieved. The context from the top-ranked document chunks is used to generate comprehensive and coherent answers to the userâ€™s questions.
